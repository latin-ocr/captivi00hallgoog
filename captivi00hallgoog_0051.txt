112 On the other hand in the early language 0 was treated
as a vowel in many words in which it was afterwards
considered a consonant ; and this usage was occasion·

’ ally adopted by later poets as an intentione] archaism.
Thus in Lucr. we find 11100101, stodeat, reliqtias, aqrtao,
101110 etc, in Hor. 01111,0111111,11101101110 0001110111, etc Ι

lama trisyllabic.

with the preceding vowel, and a succeeding short vowel
drcps out; thus fautor cautor 1101110 auceps are shortanod¹

same effect is the well—known story of Crassus (Cic. Div.
11. 40. 84), who, embarking with his army for the ill-fated
Parthian expedition, met an itinerant fig-seller crying
“Cauneas’' (sc. ficos, figs from Caunus in Asia). Thia,
