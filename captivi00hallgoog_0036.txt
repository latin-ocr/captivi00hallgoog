but also 'in other feetl, (iv) either anapaest or spondeo may,
and a spondeo usually does, preoede a tribraoh in 7th On
the other' hand (v) tho tribraoh is less common than in '
Greek especially in the nh, foot (there are only about 20
examples in this play), while in the 4th it is exoeedingly
rare: exemplos may be found at 267, 393, 411.

The apparent introduction of feet which are foreign to
the metro, such as bacchii, oratioe, eto, is to be differently
explained (inf. ξ 136 sqq.).

The Plautino scheme, then, is

57 The ictus metricus' m trochaio matre falls upon the
first syllable of the fuet, Φ ,Φ ,,Φ- Φ ,Φ
oonsequently the rule 1n iambios and anapaestios thal
anapaest must not follow tribraoh or daotyl does not apply
to trochaica.

68 The octonarius or tetrameter anat. was, like the iambio A
oct, unknown to the Greeks, who wrote the two halves
of the line separately as dimeters.

The same feet· were admitted by the Romans as in the
, septenarius, the trocheo and tribraoh alone being allowed
in tho 8th ; but as the last syllable of a verse is doubtful,

these feet are often replaced by spondeas and anapaesta.

. lt the end of the 4th foot diaeresis occurs and hiatus is
allowed.

¹ Prooeleusmatios are rerer and more objectionable in
nunno than in ianrbio metre; in· the latter, unless they are
' preceded bya daotyl or tribraeh or followed by an anapaest,
the lotus reours wr'thr'n three syllables, while in the lonmer 'it
amanly always requires four.
