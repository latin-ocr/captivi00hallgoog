826. conmeatus cibus: sometimes taken as 11 cononatus
uentri were in apposition to cibas and formed part 01 the
predicate, ‘is come into harbour as provision ior my stomach,'
but the order oi the words readers this a‘stiff construction}
out of place in such conversational Latin: more probably 1111111
11 genitive, as lectas in Am. 513 prius oble peccam lectas ubi
cubuisti concaluit locus. ·

827. hunc Hegionem senem: the usual order. Uss. quotes

hominum nemos so in Ter, Eun. 501, ’756; 01. sup. 540,
Τ11.Η11. 262 at 111111 buniam bomo 11 uiuat numquam quis·

11111011 fortunatior: see on 700.

830. ecquis ln'c esti ecquie: Blitho supplies the words in
· 1111111, after the model ol Am. 1020 operite boc: bena, ecquis
bic eet? ecquis boc operit ostiam? Bac. 582 111111101ιί1 bic

so that Erg. has now passed the 10111111 and entered the pro·
thgr-um 111 on 108.

831. ad cenam ad me: this seems inconsistent with 805,
812, 837 ; 11 11 evidently the same dinner to which Erg. had
invited himself in 1753 consequently the action ot the play
occupies but one day although the journey from Aetolia to
Elis and bach, which Phil. performe, would be at least 80
miles. Ad utc=‘to my house,’ see on 497.

ambas forts: the ostium had folding doors (uoluae), of
which one 1111 only would usually be opened; hence the

siders it due to his importunae to have both thrown wide.

832. assulatim: the reading of the uss, aet assultuum,

occur elsewhere.
