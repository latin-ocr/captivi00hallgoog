PROSODY. xlix

baa in the dative plural is sometimes long in Pl. (see
Peile p. 325), ag. Mero. 900 aedibus. aedo probat, Rud.
975 annius 0111811110.

-ea in nom. of 3rd decl, with gen. in oth, rto, tdr's, is
short in Augustan poets3 but even they make exceptione,
ug. araba, ababa, polica In the early language it was long,
in compensation for the loss of the stem dental, and the
original quantity is perhaps found in Pl, e. g. Aulula milda
impransus, As. 330 tum 1911111 ta diuos es factus.

51 from aava is always long in PL and Ter. (R. 280);
ag. lines 333, 412, 427, 837, 860 of this play. Being an
unemphatic word, it was afterwards shortened contrary to
the general rule with monosyllables, and in the Augustan
poets is always short.

The above are instances in which the general ten-
dency to shorten long unaccented syllables, especially
final ones, had not in the time of PL entirely obscured
their original quantity. In the following three instances
syllables originally long were afterwards shortened in aa·
01111100 with the general rulo in Latin that a vowel,
tanding before another vowel or diphthong and forming
separate syllable, is short.

fio: here thei was long by nature, andis found so in
a Augustan⁴ poets except in fit (supra ξ 121), 111 the
perfect subjunctive fierem etc, and in the infinitivo
i. Some of these forms could not have been used at
*n Dactylic verse, others not without elision, if the i had
1 kept long, and the Dactylic poets consequently short-

iver, tc whose matres this would not apply, sometimes
it long ; thus 998 fierent, 843 fieri, but in 587, 965, Ι
leaf.
