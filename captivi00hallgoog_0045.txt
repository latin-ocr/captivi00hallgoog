paralleled in later poets3 eg.

Verg. Ecl. v111. 108 Credimus? Aa aa! Ι amant, ipsi cibi somnia

aar?
Aen. vr. 507 Nomen et amineam seruant, ιδ Ι amice mqaiai.

With regard to monosyllables ending in -ac, it is probable

(Corssen Ausspr. 11. 790) that final m was much more dis-

tinctly heard in the time of Pl. than afterwards1,andthere·

iore, although hiatus would not be allowable aiter mono·

syllables ending in a short vowel, for they could not be

shortened by it, it might be less objectionable after mono·
’ syllables ending with -aa Even Lucretius has

111.1082 Sed datm Ι abest qaod anemae, id exsuperare uidetur.

1 89 One other point is remarked by Ussing (Proh, p. 220):
that hiatus seemed to be considered an ornament rather

than a blemish when the two open vowels were the same23
thus

Verg. G. 1. 281 Ter eant conati Ι imponere Pelia Ι Ossam.
Hor. Od 1. 28. 24 asana et capiti Ι inhumato.
11. 20. 13 Iam Daedaleo lacior Icaro. (alst uffae]

This is the case in Cap. 139, 152, 263, 354, 364, 374,
mmmmmma

90 Το sum up, hiatus can only be admitted after these
monosyllabic and dissyllabic words, unless it can be
aceounted for under one of the headings (A) or (B): in all
other cases it must be attributed to some corruption in the
text Its comparative rareness would seem almost strange
in such conversational verse if we did not know on the
authority of Cicero that the Romans were given to running
their vowels together in ordinary talk: hoc Latina lingna

¹ Quintilian, rx. 4. 40, says of final m beforesword beginning
with a vowel, ‘¹ neque enim eximitur sed obscuratur, et tantum
aliana inter duas uocales uelut nota est, ne ipsae coeant.”

2 Gellius, vn. 20, quotes several numeraturum.
