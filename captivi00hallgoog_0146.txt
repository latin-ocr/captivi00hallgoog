ACROS'HG ARGUMENT.

Onn‘ol these is prefixed to each of the plays except the Bao-

ahides, the beginning of which has beenlost. They are con-
sidered from internal evidence to be the work of a time long
subsequent to Plautus; moreover the idea ol an acrostio argu-
ment is evidently one which would occur only to a literary
student, and the plays ol Plautus were not studied as literature
until at least acentury after hia death. The form csmrvar ia
here adopted chiefly, no doubt, to gain two extra lines ior the
tfplanation of the plot, but partly also on account oiita arohaio
⁸11. In inscriptions dating towards the end of the republio nr
f⁰r 1 is found but rarely‚ and muchlesslrequently in non-final
than in final syllables.

This is not the work ol Plautus3 itis assigned by Ritaehl to
the middle oi the let century ao, when the plays of Pl. were
1⁴⁹Vived on the Roman stage; cf. the prologue to the Casina:

Nos, postquam populi rumora intelleximus
studiose expetere uos Plautinas tabulas,
antiquam elus edidimus comoediam

In the original play there was probably no prologus, the
Ffloesssry explanatione being given by the parasite Ergasilus
¹1¹ spassage at l. 94 which was afterwards out out; even as it
ἷξον stands some explanations are given there ior the second
tlnra. The way in which thia prologus was compiled irom the

test ol the play may be seen by comparing the following lines:
4 with aaa with avo anu 1011, ao with aaa and iura„ aratu
9311 vau osana 100, aa warh ror, ar with roa audisses

with 167 and 168, 34 with 111, 43 with 686.
