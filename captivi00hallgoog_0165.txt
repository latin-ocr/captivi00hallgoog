157. ΒοιοοΠ brackets this line; two objections to itare
evident: the nss. read Quod which makes romense, while
if Quoi be read the construction is chenay, at the least3 again
adactyl is followed by an anapaest (Int. 5 46. v. ), and ιιο,
secent on Philopolemrta is unnatural (cf. 95, 673). Quod οιι.
was probably a gloss on praecinctam, expanded into a verse
by some unskilful hand. Most editors however retain the
line, some explaining omnes quoi obt. se equivalent to omnes
ot cuique obt, others referring gaci to Ptilcp. which follows.
Brix and Uss. attempt to avoid this difficulty by transposing
fugitant...prcuicctam and postquam...tuoc, while ΕΙ. escapss
the metrioal difficulty by reading poet Pb. guara.

obtigerat: the Roman magistrates, unless they came ιο
some mutual arrangement, cast lots for their provinces: cf.v

158. The lines 159-164 would come more naturally from
Erg, to whom the nss. aesign thern, than from Hegio (and
Spengel therefore ffhilol. 37. 424ὲ5115118οε thus :—ER. 154, 155.
HE. 156, 157. Ε . les-164. El. 165-171); moreover the
repetition in fugitare hooc procinctam seems awkward. Poe
sibly these words were a gloss upon mirandumat and displaoed
some similar words with which Erg. began his speech3 as for
instance HE. Noc pol miscendumst. ER. Namque ad tanc
prouinciam... ; bnt it is more probable that the whole passage
152-167 is an interpolation.

opus est: the original meaning was ‘there is work ιο be

thing in question ‘is needed‚' epae was also constructed with

acquired the meaning ‘need’ ar it is used by Livy and later
writers with a gen. (R. 1225, 1226, 1255, 1256 and presto
