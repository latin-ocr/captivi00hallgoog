434. 1111101111 the subjunctive may be final, 0111111111
notioed on 296, but is more probably jussive. In prohibitione
to a definite person 611110 uses the present subj. aet. onae only
(in aproverb, aetum 11 apae, Att. rr. 18) and the present depo

nent onae only (art. xrv. 1), R. 1666 ; but both are oommon iu
the nomio poete, eg. 247, 331, 349, 393.

438. Brix oonsiders this line a gloss on 432 interponet

here: it is certainly superfluous, ae Phil. had been informed ol
grie& gfyiffigiffin 364 and by Tynd. in 379, and aguirre·

mittier: this old form of theinfinitivepassive arose, 101011-
ing to R. 614, 616, by 1111 addition of the ordinary passius ,
suffix r (which originally=ee‚ the reflsrive pronoun) in the ξ
form ·er 1ο the active infinitiva, whose final e was dissimilet& '
10 i before er. The final r was then dropped beoanse 01111 ill
1011111111 another r (R. 136), 111 ie eontraoted into i. Thus
ceraue-er, 1111111111, cerneris, 11111111. 11 the same oourse had
been followed in consonant and -i verbs, the syllable -ἕν would
have recurred (eg. mittfntr); the Romans therefore preferred
to omit tha first (R. 28), ia. to append -111 immediater to the
final consonant of 1111 stem (11.111111111ὲ. Analogy afterwards
reduced mittier, ete. to 111111. Before 1 011 220 1111111 longer
form was in use; from then to about 120 ae. was the periodol
transition, and after that the longer form was used only as 11
intentional archaism.
