PROSODY.

79 In noticing the points of difference between the
prosody'of Pl. and that of the Augustae poete, there are
two things to be remembered: first, that inaccordanoe

with the tendency of all languages tosubstitute easier
sounds for more difficult, many syllables especially final
ones, which were originally long had been shortened by the
time of Augustus ; and, secondly‚ that PL wrote when the
older Saturnian verse, which was based upon cadence or
rhythm, had been but reeentlyreplaced by the Greek me-
trical system founded upon quantity. We ere therefore
prepared to find (1) that so-called ‘licenoes' or departures
from the strict rules of this system, which are found even ’
in the Augustan poete, occur much more freely in Pl, (2)
that certain terminatione and other syllables, short in
later writers, are used by Pl. with their original long quan-

, tity, and (3) that accent, which had been supreme in the
>old Saturnian measure, is sometimes allowed by Pl. to
override the quantity of a syllable aa fixed by the Greek
metrical system, in which of course aceent hes properly no
place.

80 The first class of peculiarities, those so-called licences
which may be to some extent paralleled in the classical

poete, fall under three heads, Hiatus, Apocope and Con-
traction.
