Prosody has nothing to do. Sometimes the final consonant
was lost (eg. ablatiyal d, see cn 405) 01 weakened in pro-
nunciation‚ as with 111 and a (ἐξ 88, 93); 01111 sometimes
the final vowel, originally long, cameto 110 pronounced
short. In the following instanoes thia change had not
been completed before the time of Pl. ·

117 0 10 sometimes long in nom. sing. of proper names and
Γ* masc. nouns of lst declenaion3 eg. Sosia, Am. 439. The
Ι case originally end‘in aa, of. Gr. -ης, 0011011111, ναύτης
with poeta, aaut . The XII. Tables have poricides for·
parr'cr'do.
Ito probably had the a long originally3 see Oorssen
Ausspr. 11. p. 454 and cf. Cap. 502.

118 e final was originally long in the inf. and is occa·
sionally found so in Pl.; eg. 1111042511010, Ps 355, Mil,
848 promere.

119 e is sometimes found long in abl. of 3rd declension3 the
original form was tol (of. coueatiaoid for ccuentioafri in
S. C. de Bacch), but the ddisappeared early (aee on 405);
the i was retained throughout the classioal period in

. adjectives in -2‘a (to prevent confusion with the neuter)
and in some substantivae, but was shortened to ὅ 111 111005 ’
substantivea from about 150 nc. onwards. PL wrote in
the transitional time, and so we find iu his playa many
ablativos in iwhich later ended in ἔ (eg. corti parti larci,
etc.) as well 00 ablativae which are written with e in tha
MSS. but which the metra shews to have the last syllable
long. Such are 914 cama, 000. 1401101111εὲ, Ps. 616 milita,
Mil. 699 01010, 707 morta, Pers. 42 0011150001ιά probably -
