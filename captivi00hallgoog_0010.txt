PREFAOE.

Iu preparing the text oi this edition Ihave

availed myself oi the invaluable apparatus 00111000 in
Professor sebosus edition of the pra'y (Leipzig, 1887),
as well as 01 the collation oi V which he has included
in his preiace to the Casina (1890). From these two
sources I have coinpiled the short notes 01 10000οἀ-
ings which are given at the 1001 01 each page 01 the
text 3 they include, I think, 011 the important varia·
tions, and will at any rate enable the student to see
01 once whether any particular reading in the text
has ns. authority or not3 further than this it is in ’
my opinion inadvisable to go, in a book intended
primarily iu 00000 scholarum. The insertion 01
English stage directions in the text is intended to
avoid the necessity lor longer explanatione in the
notes and to bring the scene more vividly before the
minds 01 younger students. ⁷

In the Introduction I have devoted considerable
space 10 00 account 01 Ρ1001100 metre and prosody‚
in which I have tried 10 emphasize the lact—not
generally realized‚ at any rate by young studente-
that the versification 01 Plautus is not a thing apert, ·
either in its rules or its irregularities. The notes on
scansion, which I have added 0111101001οὶ each

page of text, will Ι hope serve a double purpose 3
