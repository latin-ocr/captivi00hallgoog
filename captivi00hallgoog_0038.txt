71 Compositeversesare those in which two difi'erent matres
are combined, the metros, however, being of similar natiue3
thus bacehlaes are combined with iambics (both being rising
rhythms) and cretics with trochaice (falling rhythms). The

five following combinatione are the most usual.

72 (1) Bacchiae dimeter÷iambic tripodia catalectic or
semiquinariue,

The second foot of the dimeter must be a bacchius and the
tripudia ought to eontain one pure iambus. There is
diaeresis between the two parts which is sometimes

sometimes found there. The following are examples of
this verset- ⁰
