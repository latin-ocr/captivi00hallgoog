There is no prologue extant to the (lure. Ep. Most. P
Sti. ; in the Trin. Rud. Gist. Aul. and Am. the prologne is a]
by a god, in the Mero. and Mil. by one of the charactersi
pley; here and in the rest of the plays it was spoken
member of the company lfferre), probably one of the yo*

pliant for the favour of the audience.

1. Hcs quos: antecedent attracted into ease of relati*
1067), as happens frequently (at any rate in early Latin)
its own clause is separated from it by the relative claus
110, 807, Verg. Aen. 1. 573 urbem, qaam statuo, cestra est,
985 illum, quem ecmatitca es, epo acm ipsas Charinidea
’745 illis, quibua incidetur, irem babent, Trin, 137 illa
ι mandauit, eum exturbasti ec aedibus. Generally, as here,
the main sentence comes, the antecedent is repeated i

proper case.

2. nn, whether taken as pron. or ads.‚is generally re
ed as corrupt, following so closely upon het or bic; see hot
as tc pronouns, on 548. Fl. suggests cincti guia, spone„
qut, Bx. ic uinclis qui. Possibly ei inquam gui may be
ingram being used in the repetition ofa phrase with a
vanafion, asmnut 758, Ps. 516. ’

the name acb-predicate, to distinguish this from the seco
predicates which are usedto complete the predication of ve
indeterminate meaning.

5. ts: the pronoun is put for emphasis before, and 0

suo sibl: sibi repeats and emphasizes the notion ol
‘his own': cf. the Freneh ‘mien t moi'; the phrase is ai
gularcolloquialism, without grammatical construction: itt
about ten times in Pl. (in Truc. 698 we have irbi ceole ce
mec tethimenem), also in Ter. (Ad. 958 acc sibi gladio
inputo) and in Columella. ·
