Pli'OSODY. xliii

m (ii) Syncope is the omission of a short vowel standing
between two consonante which may be easily pronounced
consecutively3 eg. dactru‘aapric caldas 1100011011 laniatae

: lardus maniplus [10001100 calfecit repostas perpere 11110οω

,⁵ such contractione must have been common iu ordinary

) speech In this play we have altram 8, periclum 740,
f 0100110413, surpuit 760. .

10 011 the other hand in some ceses either the MSS. pre-

} serve or the scansion demands the uncontracted form,

: even when it is one which early went out of use; eg.
Cap. 620 expurigare, 655 ermeleno, Trin. 70 0010010000,
Most. 150 discipulina, Bac. 968 0010100010.

pu (iii) Another form of contractiori is caused by the

' vowel i being pronounced as the consonant e' (y). This
method of pronunciation is adopted by the Augustan poete
in such words as utica (Verg. Aen. 11. 16), partetibus (Aen.
11. 442) 001410(Αο11. 11. 492); of. also

Vetg. G. 1. 482 Flauiorum rea Eridanus camposque per omnes.
Hor. Od. m. 4. 41 Vos leae concilium ct datis et doto.

alwaysamonosyllable in Pl.; cf. Cas. 414, Cure. 220, 236, 240.

ln scio and macto the i probably always remained
a vowel, the o being often shortened3 these verbs alone
ure found with theo short in Lucu, Verg. and Hor. Odes;
Catullus has 00ῖό and Hor. in the Satires 0010 ed 0010
dicer& instances are frequent in Ovid and later poets
treated the o in all verbs as common. lt is possible, 01
course, to scen ecc-o 1101οῶ in the scenio poete, but not
always in other writers3 eg. in Hor. Od. 111. 24. 64 neceto
