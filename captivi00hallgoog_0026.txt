THE Marsus off PLAUTUS. xix

stendiness 'co the verse, the Greeks admicbed the spondeo
in che first foot of each dipodie, ie. in the let, ard and 5eh ,-
feet: cf. Hor. A. P. 255 ,

Tardior at psallo prauiorque ueniret ad czares
Spmrdeos stabiles in iura paterna recepit [iambvrsJ.

The spondeo by the resolution of one of its long sylla-
bles into two short ones becomes either an anapaes'c ora
dactyl, both of which were admitted bytho Greek comic
dramatists in the odd feel (the dactyl' rarely in ech), while
the anapaesi appears also in 2nd and 4th. The anapeest,
however, is very rarely permilbed in Greek comedy to
stand after a tribrach or a dactyl.

'l'hus the scheme of Greek Comedy is

44 As has been already explained, che ictus in iambic
measure falls upon the latter part of the fool vt, -‡‚
and when the accenied long syllables ere resolved into
two short, upon 'che first of these two short: thus νύν,
-Φν; but Μ. Il will now be seen why in Greek iambics
an anapaest never, or very seldom, follows a tribrach
ordao'oyl (νύν Ι wi, ordv Ι ==‡); forthae would give
four syllables hom ictus to ictus, while the measure admits
at mose three syllables lo a fool.

45 ansura is a division of che verse caused by 'the ending
of a word in the middle, and not al the end of a f00l3
in lambio trimeters (and dactylic hexameters) it is found
almost invariably in the third or fourth foot3 in the
former case it is called Penbhemimeral, because it occurs
