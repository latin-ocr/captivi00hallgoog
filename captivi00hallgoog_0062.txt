PROSODY. · ’ lv

the iambus always bepim with the beginning of a word,
- but it may be made up of two words, with or without
Ι elision, or of a monosyllable and the first syllable of a

j succeeding word, or of the two first syllables oi a poly-
syllabic word ; (2) that the backwanl influence is exercised y

whether the ictae falls on a long syllable (v Α) or on the

first of two equivalent short ones (ν Aa), and whether

the syllables concemed form one or two complete words

or part only of a word or words. '
' ⁴ The matter, then, may be summed up thus :-

When the arsis orthesis of a foot in an Iambic, Trochaic
or Anapaestic line consiste of two syllables which in ordi-
nary Prosody would form an iambus, the long syllable
(whether long by nature or position) is shortened by reason
of the ictae falling upon either the preceding or the follow-

. ingsyllable3 when this happens in arsi, ie. when the in-
flusnce of the ictae is forward the iambus always begins
with the beginning of a word: but when it happens ia
llari this is not always the rasel.

¹ nor. Tyrrell in his edition oi the Miles states the matter
ihm—“ss) In words, or combinatione of words, forming in
ordinary Prosody an iambus, if the arcent (or ictus metricus)
be on the first syll.‚ the long unaccented syll. is shortened
(l) In words or combinatione of words similarly forming a
bacchius (ν--), if the accent (or ictus miricae) be on the
third sylL, the second is shortened.” Το the wording oi
tesserula no exception can be taken, for the ictae can
never all on a short syllable unless the following syllable
isintended to be also short, the two together represent-
ing the long syllable which in the original or proper foot
ol the measure would receive the ictus. But the wording of
the second rule is open to objection3 the case, as so stated,
istor instance invariable in oretics, without of course the
second syllable beinglshortened3 ag. in ‘ibt nem secumdum

mrem, the word secundum forms a bacchius with the tetus ω
