‚5 Some scholars have maintained that contractiori in
the writings of Pl. was far from being confined within
the above limita Prof. Ramsay, for instance, considered
that most of the difficulties of Plautina scansion were tc
be explained by a species of contractiori, or ‘correpticn,'
which consisted in running two syllables into one. Among
the examples which ho giwesl are the following ε- ribi ab,
ποσαί, quid boc, quod omnes, quid a, ego inter, quid tu inter,
which he supposes to have been pronounced tb' ab, ucat,
qud Isos or quid hc, quod 'uinea qud a, αρ’ buter, quid ι’ ’arten
But this theory is open to many objections; among others
that it would lead to the confusion of similar words, that
when two monosyllables were thus run together, it would
leave one of them formless and unrecognisable; and that
it would produce collocatione of consonants unknown to
latin and, one would think, beyond the power of the
human tongue to pronounce. The instances which are
given in support of it are susceptible of another and a far
more probable explanation (cf. inf. ξ 136 sqq.).

The remaining points in which Pl. scansion differs from
that of the Augustan poets are two: vowels which are
scanned short by the latter are sometimes long in Pl, and

vowels long by nature or position are sometimes scanned
¹ short in Pl.

llo The tendency to reduce the effert of articulatim, which
has been already mentioned, acts most strongly upon un-
aooented syllables, and as the final syllable in Latin was
always unaocenndss, it naturally suffered most from this
