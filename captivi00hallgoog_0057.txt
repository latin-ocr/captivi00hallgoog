so many others, by the addition of -5 to the stem. Ennius
has faui (fa—ai) aaaaui genosi, and plauit occurs often.
The consonantal a (= ) was then absorbed in the pre·

134 We now come to the chief difficulty in Plautina scan-

occur in which a long syllable stands astera short 555 and

forms with it (as is evident from the scansion of the rest

arises, are we 55 scan this iambus as 555 long syllable or
