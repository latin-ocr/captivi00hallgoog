ἜΗΕ METRES OF PLAUTUS.

31 The Greek system of versification, used for the first
time in Latin by Livius Andronicus, who began to write
about thedate of Plautus' birth, was based upon quantity,
ie. the length of time during which the voice dwells upon
the different syllables in a word. In ordinary speech there
is, of course, great variety in this respect, but for metrical
purposes the Greeks recognised only two varieties as
possible, and elassified all syllables as either short or long,
the short syllable containing one ‘time' (neore, tempas),
the long syllable being taken as equal to two short and
so containing two ‘times’

32 The different combinations of tue, three or four syl-
lables belonging to these two classes are called fect, end
two consecutive feet are sometimes called a debeatis.

33 Feet may be classified according to (a) the number of
syllables, or (b) the number of ‘times’ which they contain.

(a) the Dissyllabic feet are

Pyrrhia-v) Iambus (n)
Spondee ( - -) Trochee ( - ν )

the Trisyllabic are

Tribrsch ( ννν) (iretic (---l
Dactyl(-w) Bacchius(v--)
Amphibrach ( ν - ν) Antibacchias ( - - v)
Anapaest ( ν ν -) Molossus ( - - - )

the Tetrasyllabic are 16 in number, of which we need
only notice the

Proceleosmatic ( ww) Chorismbusl-w -l
