pauxillo ,contentus esee: the usa. have pauxillum 0. 0.
which can hardly maan ‘bo contented with 1 little,' although
Usa. thinks it possible, comparing tho usa oi the aaa. with
diqaua. It can only mean ‘be a little contented’ which makes
nonsense of urges answar aa peip. modo. So wa must either
emend pauxillo and per-pauxillo, which is difficolt on account
of tha repetition of tha aaa, or wa must take contentas 0110
in the sense of ‘eontentedly eat,’ 0001001101 being used abso·
lutely and adverbially3 either oi these uses might be paral-
leled by itseli‚ tho former 1.3. by Poon. 460 (quoted on 643),
tha latter ‚by Hor. Sat. 1. 1. 3,1. 4. 108, but the combination of
thern is very awkward.

177. lis perpauxfflo modo=rnodo ne peip. (01. Ter. Ad.

roga amptum=⁸strike the bargain‚’ lit. propoae or stipu-
lata that tho thing (Erg.¹s company) be bought. Rogare is
used oi tha person who aslis the formal question in 1 stipti-
