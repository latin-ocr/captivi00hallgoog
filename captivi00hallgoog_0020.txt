THE MANUSORIPTS OF PLA UTUS. xiii

for the most part correctly divided and the contractioris are
not many or difficult. There is no division into acts;
speses were left by the original copyists for the headings·
of scenes and the names ci speakers, and in most cases
these have been subsequently filled in. In many of the
plays corrections have been made by various hands.

2ss G, the Codex Decurtatus (so called because, although
it originally contained the whole twenty plays, the first
eight had been torn off before it came into the possession

¹ of Camerarius), is a cursive MS. of the llth century,
written in Germany by different hands; it hears a strong
resemblance to D, but the writing is not so good and the
words are more often wrongly divided. lt is also very like
B, and it is clear that these three MSS. were derived,
though not immediately, from the same source.

27 In 1815 Cardinal Mai discovered that a copy of the
Book of Kings in the Ambrosiam Library at Milan had
been written on parchment which had previously formed
part of a MS. of the plays of Plautus, dating probably from
the 4th century. This MS. (now known as the Milan
Palimpsest and quoted by Ritschl as A) had originally
consisted of bundles (fascicula) of four sheets of parchment
laid upon one another and doubled down the middle so asto
form sixteen pages in each fasciculis. In the ath century
these had been taken to pieces and some of them washed
and scraped so as to receive the new writing and then re·

¹ bound, but not of course in the original order. The re-
mainder of the original MS. has been lost, while of those
sheets which we have the original writing is in some '
totally illegible, in others only a few lines or a few letters
are to be deciphered its readings however, where legible,
are cf course of the greatest authority. It is clearly

³ written in capital letters without any division between

ι words. Originally the MS. contained all the m vanc-

nothing is now left of the first three plays or the Cur·
