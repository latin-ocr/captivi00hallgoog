PROSODY. xxxv

diphthong or a, the final syllable of the former word is
said to be elided, ie. must be omitted in scanning3 and
the neglect of this elision is called Hiatus.

32 The question when hiatus should be admitted in
Pl, and when its occurrence should make us suspect
corruption in the· text, is oue upon which scholars have
differed greatly. Some, by alterations and insertione in
the text and the introduction of various archaia forms,
have succeeded in eradicating it almost entirely3 but this
methodis certainly unscientific‚ because it is the text of
the MSS. which forms the main source of our knowledge
¹of the subject. The proper course is surely to classify all
the instances which are found in the MSS„ omitting those
which occur in lines otherwise suspicions or unmetrical or
of which the scansion is doubtful ; the probability of each
class will depcud upon the number of undoubted instances
which it contains

83 The Captiui contains 60 or 70 such instaures, which
fall into three classes; those which occur (A) at a divi-
si'on of the verse, or (B) at a pause or break in the sense,
or which· (C) are to be justified by the form of the words
themselves.

84 Α. Of the first class we may remark that even in,
the ·Augustan poets hiatus is sometimes found at the
caesura: eg.

Verg.Ecl.111.6 Et curcua pecori Ι et loc subducitur uyur's.

(l) Similarly in Pl. hiatus is generally admitted attha
danaus of tetrameters, eg.

Mil. 358 Quid uta tu, Sceledre? S. Hauc reru yero; l haheo
uaria loquare quiduis (iam. sept). cf. Gap. 510.

Gap. 780 Speroque ura ob huuc nautium Ι ueternum adepturum
cibum (iam. oct).

Men. 900 Vt ahsente ero rem Ι ert dilipcuter thau. tetra. Qt.
Cup. 505.
