xviii INTRODUCTION.

Tragedy. Hence that part of the foot which receives the
ictus was originally called the θέσις, for there the reciter
put down his hand or his foot, while the part which is free
from the ictus was called the ἄρσις, forthere he lifted it up.
This was the usage of the older grammarians Dionysius
and Hephaestio; but later writers, such as Priscian and
Martianus Capella (ath century A.n.)‚ thinking that these
. terms referred to the voice and noticing that stress is laid
upon a syllable by raising the voice not by lowering it,
reversed the practice of their predecessore and called that
part of the foot which received the ictus the ἄρσις and the
other the θέσιςς and this usage is now so well established
that any attempt to return to the ancient practice would
only lead to confusion The words will therefore be used
here in the later and less correct way, as referring to the
voice, that part of the foot upon which the stress is laid
being called the ἄρσις or said to be ιἰι arsi, while the other

part is called the θέσις cr said to be in theri.

’ 41 In an iambus, anapaest or bacchius the stross falls upon
the final long syllable; in a trochee, cretic or dactyl upon
the initial long syllable. And so with the measures of
which these are the original ·feet; in the Iambic Anapaestic
and Bacchiae measures the ictus falls on the latter part of

the foot whether it be the proper foot of the measure or
any other foot which may be substituted therefor, while
in Trochaic, Cretic and Dactylic it falls on the first part.
42 Thus there are two distinct and opposite kinds of verse,
that in which the feet begin with the tdcsc’s (rising rhythm),

and that in which they begin with the arsis (falling
rhythm). We will consider first the rising rhythms.

43 The iambic senarius, or iambic trimeter scat, is the
usual vehicla of ordinary stage dialogus. The original foot
was the iambus, for which the equivalent tribrach was

adrnrssible in every place but the last, bauto give more
