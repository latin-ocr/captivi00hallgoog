103 11,1H1. Instances oi i before another vowel forming
one syllable with it are usually to be explained by thei
being treated as a consonant (ξ 109), but where the second
vowel is another i contraction probably takes place. Thus
Hor. Ep. 1. 1. 71 tudiciis fruar t'tsdem, Verg, Aen. v. 269
euirati tempora racana· so in ordinary speech gratiis was
contracted to protis, audiisse to audisse, mibi nibil tc mi nit,
etc.; dit, a· are probably always contracted in the early poets.

104 ΟΙ, ΟΗΙ. 1111111976 guod prdb‘r'bcut efficiatque, Verg.
Aen. x1. 383 proinde tono, and preinde probably always in good
writers. In this play we have prfflribere 804, prata always.

105 Perhaps the scansion of cias, buius, quoius as mono·
syllables is due to synaeresis, the a coalescing with the
previous diphthong ei ai οἱ, instances are

Lucra. 139 Principiam cnara binc nobis exordia sumat.
Cio. Arat. Atque aar ipae manet religatus corpore torto.

In this play we have ewa 107, 289, lame 39, 641, 800,
qums 106, as well as other instances which may be ex-
plained by apocope of the final a

10ss The scansion of cio is peculiar: the original form
was cri-io (so written by uia, according to Quint. 1. 4. ll ;
in Trin. 428, A has nitebas, in 642 maiicrea, in 201 pei·
turias), but the first i was usually dropped both in writing
and pronunciation‚ the a being either shortened or taken as ·
a diphthong with the following i; ag. either aa (Gap. 592
613) orat (Cap. 567, 979), sometimes, however, the original
length of the first syllable is preserved as in ait Gap. 365,
dia Am. 284, As. 901. With regard to the imperfect,
the Mss. always have the uncontracted form aalma,
etc. 3 but often the metre shews the scansion to be dabam -
asin Cap. 561,

Mero. 635 &uiuesceret daperepriaas. Ctucmeaseaitcntdttim.
804 Rue abitare aibant. Naar domam renuntio.

On the other hand, the longer form is required in Gap.
676, Trin. 428, Am. 387, abc.
