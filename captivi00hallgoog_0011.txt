iv PREFACE.

they will guide young students in scanning the lines,
and they will complete the general account in the
Introduction by pointing out the particular illustra-
tions to be found in the text of this play.

In writing the commentary Ι have made use of
all previous editions and have to acknowledge my
indebtedncss especially to those of Brix and Ussing.
I have tried to make the notes illustrate the grammar
and phraseology not merely oi this play, but of
Plautus as a whole, and with that object have quoted
more freely than I should otherwise have done from
the rest oi the plays. Moreover Ι have attempted in
the notes to eall attention to as many points as
possible—some ol them may seem ol minor importance
-helicving that a better knowledge of the language
and more valuable habits of mind are acquired by
the thorough study ol one work, or even ol a portion
of one work, thau by the hasty reading of half-a-
dozen.

The grammars to which I have referred are Roby’s
Grcmmor of uu Latin Lurtyuoyc aud Kennedy’s Jo-
uised Latin Primam these are referred to us R. and
ι Κ., and quoted by sections. In the quotatious from
other Plautine plays the references are to Tyrrell's
Miles, Benoist’s Cistellaria, Ussing’s Mostellaria and
Persa, and in the case of the remainder to Ritschl's
new edition.
