The division oi Latin eomedies into Acis was known to
- Varro and cio. (Verr. 11. 6. 18, Q. F. 1.1. 16) and to Hor. (A.
i P. 189 neae minor nen sit quinto productior acta Fatale) but
was probably unknown to Pl. or Ter. The ress. divide only
into soenes, and the plays were probably acted straight on,
without any interval. Where, however, a character leaves the
stage ai the end of a scene and raenters ai the beginning oi
she next, 01 where, for any ether reason, some spaee oi time
must elapsa between two consecutive soenes, 1110 interval was
filled up by musio from the tibicen: ei. Ps. 573 tibicen aas
interea bic delectaverit. Whoever divided the Captiui into
Acts would have dono better to make the 5111 begin with this
soene, before which an interval is necessary, rather than with
1110 next, as in the ress.

909. Diespiter=Dies Pater, an old name ior Jove, ef.
Iuppiter (=Iosapater). The words dies dininas discos deas δῖος
Ζεύς Iouis (old form Dionis) are all connected, the common
idea being ‘brightness‘ For Diespiter dique see on 898.

911. modoln: most editors‘retain these words and read
clades calamites, with Bbthe3 but this does 1101 seem probable
in view oi the nss. readings and the singular verb aduenit. For
the noo. aiter aduenire, ei. Veig. Aen. 1. 388, 1001010001αά-
ueneris urbem, and 11010011 548. For intemperies ci. Colum.
praei. caeli nucia frugibus intemperies; calamitas also was
originally applied to the destruction oi crops by storms, oi.
eat. R. R. 141, Ter. Eun. 79 nostri fandi calcantes, (lic.
Verr. m. 98 in calamitate fncctnaas.

modo is used oi the immediate past, the-present and the
immediate iuinre; ei. As. 927 modo odiam, non naor, erana,
{grdoffigaew modo dolores accipiant primatum, And. 594 domam

912. After this verse, parts oi a line beginning with
unruonr and ending with rnrnrun have been deeiphsred
in A. Theiact otiis having ended with the same warh aa
tbr's resse werrici 00000111 for its accidental omission.
