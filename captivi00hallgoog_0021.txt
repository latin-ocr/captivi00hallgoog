xiv INTRODUCPION.

00110. 01 the Captioi onlya 1077 fragments of two passages
remain (905-931, loos—1029). An elaborate edition of
this MS. by Studemund has recently been published ι
(Berlin, 1890). .

28 ln addition to these four MSS, ABOD, there are three
or four others which require notice, although 01 secondary
importence. V is a cursive Ms, dating from the begin-
ning of the 12111 century, in the University Library at
Leyden. Doubtless it originally contained the first eight
plays, but its beginning and end have been mutileted and
it now comprises the Aulularia (190—end), Captiui, Cor-
celio, Casina, Cistellaria 011οΕ010000 (to 244). An account
01 it may be found in Schoell’s preface 10 his edition of
the Casina. E is ecursive MS. 01 the 13111 century, and
contains the first eight plays. J , which is preserved in
the British Museum, (10100 from the beginning of the rath
century. lt is 0 MS. 01 194 leaves, 01 which the first 112
contain three treatises of Cicero, the remainder the first
eight plays of Pl. It has been damaged by fire, and the
beginnings end ends of lines are often illegible.

29 These three Mss. are considered to heve had acommon
archetype, belonging 10 the same family as B and D and
related to both 01 them in the same way as they are related
10 each other; to this archetype V corresponds most closely,
then E; the authority 01 J being reckoned lower than
1110101 the other two. These Mss. are obviously of velue
to supplement B in those plays (including the 1001 half
of the captiuo) where neither O nor D is availeble How
they agree in reproducing errore in which their archetype
differed from B and D may be seen in the critical notes on
lines 35, 90, 151, 174, 000, 400, 400, 400, 000, 010, 070, 010,
777, 004, 017, 000, 001, 000, 1000,

30 A fragment 01 the Captivi (400-559) is contained in
a MS. (Ο) which Loewe considers 01 the same age 00 D;

r't is transcri bed in Goetz’s Analecta Plautina, p. 86 sqq.
