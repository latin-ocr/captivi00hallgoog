91 This is the neglect in scansion of a final letter, other-
wise than by elision The name is objectionable, as it
implies that the poets owtri gratie cut off a letter which
was proncunced in ordinary speech. The contrary is the
fact3 the earlydramatists and poets, in the peculiarities
noticed below, merely followed the popular pronunciation,

. in which sounds were omitted or weakened to a much
greater extent than ever appeared in the written language:
this was due to the constant tendency, felt in all languageS,
to reduce the effert of articulation.

[22 The effect of this tendency upon final letters and

¹ syllables is noticed in ξ 116 ,· the two instances of it which
come under the head of Apocope are:

(1) The interrogative particle -oe, when added to a

ξ’ word ending in a vowel, and followed by a word beginning
ξ with a consonant, was probably proncunced simply as η’,
i at any rate in short sharp questions, and the early poets

frequently, and the later ones sometimes, followed this

general usage3 eg. Verg. Aen. xn. 503 tantca' placuit, 797
mortalia' decuit, Cap. 643 certoc’? Quia...., etc.

(2) Afinala',inwords ending ints or cia, was in early
poetry frequently neglected before a consonant, the

final syllable thus remaining short. Oieero, in speaking
of this usage1, mentions only the termination ccc, but cf.
