once. The young men then go in to bathe after their
journey. '

7 Hegio remains behind to question Stalagmus ; with

ii, tho greatest indifference and sang-sroid this rascal tells

’ how he had stolen off with Hegio's younger son and sold
him into slavery at Elis. ‘To whoml’ aske Hegio. ‘To
Theodoromedes the father of Philocrates!

la Hegio summons Philocrates from the house ,and it

fii then appears (as the spectatore have known all along)
that the long-lost son is no other than the faithful Tyn·
durus.

19 This is no sooner made clear than Tyndarus himself

iv, appears, leden with fetters and carrying the pick which ’

hc has been using in the quarries. He begins describ·
ing his sufferings there, when he is suddenly overwhelmed
with joy in recognising Philocrates3 his real identity
is then explained to him, but he takes some timeto
grasp the wonderful news. A blacksmith is sent for
to transfer his fetters to Stalagmus, and the¹ play ends
with a short epilogue sung by the whole of the company.

THE MANUSORIPTS OF PLAUTUS.

20 In speaking of the manuscripts of Plautus a distinction
is drawn between the first eight plays and the last twelve;

by the first eight plays one means the Amphitruo, Aenaria,
nataae, capati, omna, ceresaria, carata and apa-
dr'cas ; the last twelve are tho Baccheidos, theecbma‘ and
the rest. The alphabetical order which obteins (as far as
the initial letters are concerned) among the other plays is
departed from in the case of the Bacobiolea, doubtless
because it contains an allusion to the aptatam, to which
it was therefore subsequent in point of time.
