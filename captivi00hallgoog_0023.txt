xvi INTRODUOTION.

34 (b) These feet may be tabulated according to the
number of ‘times' they contain, thus :-

35 A combination of not more than eight feet, arranged
according to certain mles, is called a nerse or liam this
forms a metrical unit and is, in most kinds of verse,
to be scanned by itself, independently of the lines which

precede and follow3 when this is the case, it ends with the
end of a word, and the last syllable is ‘doubtful,' i.e.‚ is
considered long or short according to the requirements of
the metro, whatever its real quantity may be.

36 When a verse, instead of ending with a complete foot,
has the last syllable wanting, it is called Catalectio ; if
two syllables are wanting, Brachycatalectic; if the line is
complete, Acatalecti03 if there be one or two syllables too
many, Hypercatalectic.

37 Verses are sometimes named from the number of leet
they contain, a senarius containing 6 feet, a septenarius 7,
an octonarius 8, &a

33 ‘Metro’ has two meanings: in the wider and more
usual sense it means a kind of verse, es when we speak of

’ Iambic metre, but in the narrower and more technical
sense, ‘a metre' means either a single foot, or a dipodia ; in
lambio, Trochaic and Anapaestic verse, a metre consiste of

'a tippodia, being the first, or any subsequent, pair of feet,
ma ineteg.
