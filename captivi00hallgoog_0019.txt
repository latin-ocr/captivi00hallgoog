xii INTRODUCTION.

21 At the beginning 01 the loth century only the first ¹
eight plays, so understood, were known tc exist3 the last
twelve had been lost. But in 1428 a MS. was discovered
in Germany which comprised 001 only the Am, Aa, Aur,
and half the Captivi (to 503), but also the missing twelve.
This MS. (now known as D) was brought to Rome and
passed into the hands of Cardinal Orsini, after whom it
is named the Codex Ursinianus; by him it was placed in
the Vatican Library, where it now is. It is a cursive MS.
01 German origin dating from the llth century, written
by the same hand throughout; the lines are generally run ⁴
together and the words are often wrongly divided.

22 Various transcripta were made 01 it, but, as every tran-

dependent to a great extent upon interpolated copies 01 D.

[eipsic obtained possession 01 two other MSS. previously
unknown, B and O, upon which he founded his edition
(Lips. 1552„ after his death they were purchased and
placed in the Palatine Library, and subsequently removed
to the Vatican. B still remains there, O was transferred
in 1797 tc Paris, and in 181510 Heidelberg, where it still is.
25 Β, the Oodex Vetus Camerarii, is a crnsive MS. 01
the llth century, containing all the plays and occupying
213 10110 sheets. It is irregularly written by different
hands, but, speaking generally (for the execution 01 the
