x INTRODUOTION

for Hegio: no more asking now and then for 0 frugal meal:
Hegio will be only too delighted 1ο offer him perpetual·
banquets. '
15 While he is approaohing the house in this frame of
1'v‚ fi, mind, Hegio comes down the street in 0 01010 01 dejec-
tion that serves as a strong contrast; he catches sight of
Ergasilus and, supposing him to have comebaek to dinner,
he listens in surprise to the bombastic threats which
Ergasilus is pouring forth against all and sundry who may
, impede his triumphal progress to Hegio’s house. When
Ergasilus has reached the door he 0000010 him, and then
000000 0 geme of arose-purposes. Ergasilus proposes the
most extravagant preparation for a meal without saying
why ; Hegio tells him heis reving; Ergasilus insiste, Hegio
refuses. Then Ergasilus tells his news3 he hes run 011 1110Ι
way from the horbour, where he has just witnessed the
return 01 Philocrates with Hegio's son Philopolemus and the
slave Stalagmus who had escaped twenty years before, and
whom Philopolemus had recognised and secured in Elis.
At first Hegio refuses 10 believe that this een be true, but
when 01 lest he sees thet Ergasilus is in earnest he gives
him carte blanche as to the preparatione for a 10001

the house in an equal hurry 10 begin his congenial
labours.
16 The fifth Act begins with the appearance 01 0 slave
v, i, from the house, who describes the outrageous proceed-
ings oi Ergasilus in the kitohen and the pantry. Then
Hegio returns with the two young men and the runaway
slave, whom he had met 01 the harbour. He expresses
his deep gratitude 10 Philocrates and wonders how he
ean ever repay him. ‘By restoring Tyndarus,' answers
Philocrates, ‘to his Elean master, who purposes to eman-
cipate him! Hegio then relatos his discovery of tho
deception practised upon him and hisoonsequent harshness
to Tyndarus, to fetoh whom 0 messenger is despatched 01
